# Connect4-Game
This is a version of the classic Connect 4 game implemented in Java. It is meant to be played with two players, represented by 0 and O respectively. They choose columns in which to "drop" their tokens, stacking them on top of one another in the hopes of winning by chaining four of their tokens either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 
This game was made for fun, and also to practice programming skills. Specifically, it was a chance to practice using two-dimensional arrays.
This program has three classes. Connect4 runs the game. Game contains the code for cycling through a game until a winner is declared. The Board class handles updating the board based on the players' moves and checking for a winner. 
An example of the code in action:
